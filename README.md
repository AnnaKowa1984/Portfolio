# Portfolio

For many years I worked as an emergency paramedic, developing my soft skills and teamwork skills working with people, and at the same time looking for best professional path for myself – graduated engineering degree in Geodesy and Cartography, master’s degree in National Security, completed postgraduate studies as a Software tester for mobile and server applications. I find the subject of software testing very interesting, and I want to develop further in this direction, ultimately in automation testing. In this page I would like to share my experiences.
