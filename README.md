My name is Anna Kowalska. For many years I worked as an emergency paramedic, developing my soft skills and teamwork skills in working with people, but at the same time always looking for a different idea – graduated engineering degree in Geodesy and Cartography, master’s degree in National Security, completed postgraduate studies as a Software tester for mobile and server applications. The subject of software testing has interested me very much, and I want to develop further in this direction, finally in testing automation. On this page I would like to share my experiences.
